## Description  
A spring-themed catching falling object game where players collect falling objects - food/object relating to creating a picnic while avoiding unwanted items. This project explores how to create interactive games and display beautiful artwork through python code 
( take inspiration from LADS‚Äôs game event, The Incident, Falling Stuff, etc)

## Features  
- Player Control with Arrow Keys/ keyboard
  - A basket controlled with left/right arrow keys or keyboard to catch falling items.
  - If the player catch the right items, add point 
  - If the player catch the wrong items, minus point or end the game (game over)

- Falling Picnic Items
  - Food items like üçì, üç°, and ü•™ will fall from the sky, created with basic sprite logic and gravity.

- Collision Detection and Scoring System 
  - Player gains points for catching snacks, and loses points catching unwanted objects, some object may cause the game the end (game over)

- Spring Background and Soft Visuals
  - Uses colorful backgrounds, for example beautiful falling petals, light sky. Keep the aesthetic to spring vibes and cute

- Start and Game Over Screen
- Basic UI screens made with Pygame and text rendering.

## Challenges  
- Learning how to animate falling objects smoothly with Pygame.  
- Implementing sprite collision detection for various item types.  
- Designing cute visuals and choosing a color palette that supports the theme.
