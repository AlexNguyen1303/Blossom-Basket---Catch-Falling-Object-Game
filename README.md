## Description  
A spring-themed catching falling object game where players control a picnic basket and catch falling picnic items—🍓 strawberries, 🥪 sandwiches, and 🧃 juice boxes—while dodging unwanted items like 🪳 bugs, 👢 boots, and 🗑️ moldy trash. The goal is to collect enough points to have a fantastic picnic.

The game includes:
- A soft pastel aesthetic with an easy-to-navigate UI, the Basket on the UI also has a floating animation..
- A combo system that activates when a player collects 20 items in a row, a combo that rewards the player with double points and a glowing effect.
- A countdown introduction screen gives the player the necessary information, a score, and a streak panel.
- Background music and unique sound effects for each action (collecting items, combo activation, game over, and winning).
- Three separate game screens: Start Menu, Win Screen, and Game Over screen, all animated with floating baskets.

### Project Structure
- `project.py`: Main game file containing all logic, visuals, and sound integration.
- `assets/`: A folder containing all images (basket sprites, background) and audio files (background music, sound effects).
- `requirements.txt`: Lists `pygame` as the required third-party library.
- `README.md`: Explains the project

### Design Considerations
The game aims to bring the player a good, chill experience. It is easy to play but challenging enough to keep the player focused. 

### Future Improvements
- Add more levels and increase difficulty per level
- Add a basket skin/customization system.
- Add enemies that distract the player if needed
